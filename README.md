FORKED FROM OHIO FGC - UPDATED CURRENTLY BY AARON CURRY.

# South Dakota FGC Website

The South Dakota Fighting Game Community can feel small, but that's only due to the size of the state! Between the West River scene, hosted in Rapid City, and the East River scene, hosted in Sioux Falls, there's plenty of folks who'll throw down in your favorite kind of games! This is a way to consolidate info and get the word out that SoDak is coming back and we're here to play!  So this website is an attempt to help consolidate information to make it easier for people to find the events and players near them.

If you think something should be added to the site, get in contact with me here or on [twitter](https://x.com/aaroncurrydish).

You can view the site [here](https://acurrydish1.github.io/SoDakFGC.github.io/). It is currently being updated so bear with me!
